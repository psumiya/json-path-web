This project contains the frontend files necessary to render an online Json Path evaluator, as seen here: https://sumiya.page/jpath.html.

The Json Path implementation used behind the scenes is jayway jsonpath.

The jayway library is wrapped in an API call, the source code of the wrapper is here: https://github.com/psumiya/json-path-api
